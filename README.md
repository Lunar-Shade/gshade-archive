# gshade-archive

So the original author and owner of GShade decided to introduce malware into the program. This is a repository of the original GShade available presets and shaders. I will not be updating this repository, but I will be keeping it up for archival purposes.

Sooner or later, I will be uploading in this repository the original GShade source code free of said malware.

Stay tuned for a custom fork of GShade that will be free of malware and will be open source.
